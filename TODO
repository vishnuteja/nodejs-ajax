I created this before I really understood REST or MVC, so it is a little bit
disorganised...  I need to re-factor it at some point since people are actually
forking it and trying it, so that it shows good practice and good design.  This
is the first node.js app I ever created, so it is currently an example of exactly
how *not* to use node.
